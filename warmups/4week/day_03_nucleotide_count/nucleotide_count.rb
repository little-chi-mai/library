# # Nucleotide Count

# DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

# Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.

# Write a program that will tell you how many times each nucleotide occurs in a string.

# It should also tell you if a character in the string is _not_ a valid nucleotide.

# Example:

# ```ruby
# count_nucleotides "AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC"
# # output:
# A: 20
# C: 12
# G: 17
# T: 21
# ```
